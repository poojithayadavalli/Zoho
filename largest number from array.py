"""
Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them in such a manner that they form the largest number possible.The result is going to be very large, hence return the result in the form of a string.

Input:
The first line of input consists number of the test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows:
The first line of each test case contains the size of the array, and the second line has the elements of the array.

Output:
In each separate line print the largest number formed by arranging the elements of the array in the form of a string.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 102
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 103

Example:
Input:
2
5
3 30 34 5 9
4
54 546 548 60

Output:
