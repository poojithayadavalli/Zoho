"""
Given two strings str1 and str2, find if str1 is a subsequence of str2. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements (source: wiki). Expected time complexity is linear.

Examples :

Input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "ADXCPY"
Output: True (str1 is a subsequence of str2)

Input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "YADXCP"
Output: False (str1 is not a subsequence of str2)

Input: str1 = "gksrek", str2 = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: True (str1 is a subsequence of str2)
