Given four different points in space. Find whether these points can form a square or not.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.The first line of each testcase contains x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4(four points coordinates) separated by space.

Output:
Print "Yes"(without quotes) if it is square else "No"(without quotes).

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ x1, x2, x3, x4, y1, y2, y3, y4 ≤ 100
